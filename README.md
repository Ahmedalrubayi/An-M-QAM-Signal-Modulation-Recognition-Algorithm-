Title: "Logarithmic Classifier for High-Order M-QAM Modulation Classification in Noisy Channels"
Summary: This paper addresses the challenge of automatic modulation classification (AMC), specifically focusing on high-order multilevel quadrature amplitude modulation (M-QAM) schemes such as 128-QAM, 256-QAM, 512-QAM, and 1024-QAM, which are commonly used in wireless communication. The primary objective is to enhance the classification accuracy of these modulation schemes under adverse conditions, including additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and various fading channel scenarios.
Contributions and Strong Points:
Novel Approach: The paper introduces a novel approach for AMC by leveraging the natural logarithmic properties and extracting higher-order cumulant's (HOC) features directly from the raw input data. This innovative technique enhances the intelligence of the classification model.

Feature Extraction: The study focuses on extracting HOC features from received signals, offering a unique perspective in the context of modulation classification. This feature extraction method contributes to improved classification accuracy.

Robustness in Noisy Channels: The proposed logarithmic classifier has a high classification rate even at signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) as low as 5 dB, which is a measure of how much noise there is in the signal. This robustness is essential for real-world wireless communication systems where noise and interference are common.

Versatility: The logarithmic classifier is shown to perform well not only under AWGN but also under various fading channel conditions. This versatility makes it suitable for a wide range of practical applications in wireless communication systems.

Superior Performance: The results suggest that the logarithmic classifier-based AMC system outperforms previous works in automatic modulation identification. This superior performance is a significant contribution to the field of AMC.

In one word, this paper shows a new way to classify high-order M-QAM modulation schemes in noisy channel environments by using a logarithmic classifier. Its contributions include feature extraction from raw data, robustness in challenging conditions, and versatility across different channel scenarios. The results indicate a high classification rate and superior performance compared to existing methods, making it a valuable addition to the field of automatic modulation classification.
